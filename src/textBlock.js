          The most popular way to create
          your own website or blog was developed. In fact, WordPress powers over 43.3% of all
          the websites on the Internet. Yes â€“ more than one in four websites
          that you visit are likely powered by WordPress. <br />
          <br />
          On a slightly more technical level, WordPress is an open-source
          content management system licensed under GPLv2, which means that
          anyone can use or modify the WordPress software for free. A content
          management system is basically a tool that makes it easy to manage
          important aspects of your website â€“ like content â€“ without needing to
          know anything about programming. <br/><br/>
          The end result is that WordPress
          makes building a website accessible to anyone â€“ even people who arenâ€™t
          developers.
